===========================
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
===========================

This program is a Python-based Hospital Management System designed to simulate key hospital operations. 
It is fully menu-driven and runs in the terminal/command line. I created it to demonstrate 
my knowledge of classes, functions, inheritance, and exception handling.

===========================
HOW TO RUN
===========================

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Save the program file as: hospital_system.py
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file.
5. Run it using: python hospital_system.py
6. Follow the menu instructions to interact with the system.

===========================
FUNCTIONALITIES
===========================

The program includes the following features:

1. Add Patient:
   - Input patient info: name, DOB, gender, address, contact.
   - Auto-generates unique Patient ID.
   - Stores and retrieves patient profiles.

2. Add Doctor:
   - Input doctor info: name, DOB, gender, address, specialty, contact.
   - Auto-generates unique Doctor ID.
   - Stores schedule and allows viewing.

3. Book Appointment:
   - Match patient and doctor using their IDs.
   - Assigns date/time and prevents double booking.

4. Cancel Appointment:
   - Search by Appointment ID and remove the session.

5. View Patient Profile:
   - Displays all info and appointments for that patient.

6. View Doctor Schedule:
   - Shows all future appointments for a doctor.

7. Print Bill:
   - Adds JMD $3000 consultation fee.
   - Allows input of custom service charges.
   - Prints formatted receipt.

===========================
REQUIRED MODIFICATIONS
===========================

- To support persistent data storage, the system could be extended to use files or a database.
- Authentication for admin access could be added.
- A GUI could be implemented using Tkinter for better user experience.

===========================
ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS
===========================

- All dates must be entered in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- All times must use the format HH:MM (24-hour).
- Contact numbers must be exactly 10 digits.
- System data is stored in memory only (not saved on exit).
- Multiple users cannot book the same doctor at the same date and time.
